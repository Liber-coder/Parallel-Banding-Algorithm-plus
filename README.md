This is the improved version of the Parallel Banding Algorithm, we call it PBA<sup>+</sup>. Parallel Banding Algorithm is an algorithm to compute the exact Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) for a binary image in 2D and higher dimensions on GPU, you can find more on our [website](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tants/pba.html).

Running environment: CUDA 9.0
